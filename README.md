# TinyApp

Converts a regular URL to a shortened URL

Landing page allows users to input a URL but requires them to register an account or log in before creating the short URL.

When a logged out user attempts to access a page by URL (eg http://localhost:8080/urls/o8pElq) they are taken to a log in prompt, a successful log in will load the page they originally attempted to access.

TinyApp in header is a link to '/' which redirects to /urls for logged in users.
